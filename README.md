# Nockup: the NockApp channel installer

*Nockup* installs the Hoon programming language and produces a basic template app for the NockApp framework.

NockApp is a general-purpose framework for building apps that run the Nock ISA.  It is particularly well-suited for use with [Nockchain](https://nockchain.org) and the Nock ZKVM.

## Usage

Nockup supports the following `nockup` commands.

### Management

- `install`:  Initialize Nockup cache and download templates.
- `update`:  Check for updates to `nockup`, `hoon`, and `hoonc`.
- `help`:  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s).

### Project

- `start`:  Initialize a new NockApp project from a .toml config file.
- `build`:  Build a NockApp project.
- `run`:  Run a NockApp project.

### channel

- `channel list`: List all available channels.
- `channel set`: Set the active channel, from `stable` and `nightly`.  (Most users will prefer `stable`.)

## Installation

1. Install Nockchain and build `hoon` and `hoonc`.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/zorp-corp/nockchain.git
    $ cd nockchain
    $ make install-hoonc
    $ cargo install --locked --force --path crates/hoon --bin hoon
    ```

2. Install Nockup.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/sigilante/nockup.git
    $ cd nockup/
    $ cargo build --release
    ```

    `nockup` builds by default in `./target/release`, so further commands to `nockup` refer to it in whatever location you have it.

    Alternatively, you may install it globally using Cargo:

    ```
    $ cargo install --path .
    ```

## Usage

The final product is, of course, a binary which you may run either directly or via `nockup run` (as demonstrated here).

## Uninstallation

To uninstall Nockup delete the binary and remove the installation cache:

```
$ rm -rf ~/.nockup
```

## Disclaimer

*Rustup is entirely experimental and many parts are unaudited.  We make no representations or guarantees as to the behavior of this software.*

Nockup uses HTTPS for binary downloads (overriding HTTP in the channel manifests).  The commands `nockup install` and  `nockup update` both check the Blake3 and SHA-1 hashes of the downloaded binaries against the reported index.

Code building is a general-purpose computing process, like `eval`.  You should not do it on the same machine on which you store your wallet private keys.

## Roadmap

* [ ] implement CI with index for channels and versioning
  1. Build CI pipeline for matrix of Linux/macOS, stable/nightly, and aarch64/x86_64.
  2. Post binaries.
* [ ] add code signing support

## Contributors

Some CLI testing has been implemented and is accessible via `cargo test`.
